# Password Generator 

- - - - 

## Overview - 

This is a project done using python. Essentially, the user is prompted to enter the length of a password they would like to have randomly generated for them and the program will generate a password of desired length by randomly selected a combination of different characters including:

- digits [0-9]
- lowercase letters [a-z]
- uppercase letters [A-Z]
- symbols (i.e: $, #, @) 

once the program has generated the password it will be returned to the user. Addtionally, using the python library 'pyperclip', the user is given an option to 
copy and paste their password to their clipboard so they can just paste (CONTROL + V) the password into any password field when signing up for some account!
